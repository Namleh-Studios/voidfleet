<h3>5.3 Parental Rights</h3>
<p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <strong>euzauc@gmail.com</strong>. We will promptly delete any such information.</p>

<h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>

<h3>6.1 GDPR Rights (EEA/UK Residents)</h3>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Access</strong> the personal data we hold about you.</li>
    <li><strong>Rectify</strong> inaccurate personal data.</li>
    <li><strong>Erase</strong> your personal data ("right to be forgotten").</li>
    <li><strong>Restrict</strong> processing of your personal data.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Portability</strong> &mdash; receive your data in a structured, machine-readable format.</li>
    <li><strong>Object</strong> to processing based on legitimate interests.</li>
    <li><strong>Withdraw Consent</strong> at any time via the in-game Settings menu.</li>
    <li><strong>Lodge a Complaint</strong> with your local data protection authority.</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.2 CCPA/CPRA Rights (California Residents)</h3>
<p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act, you have the right to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Know</strong> what personal information we collect, use, and share.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong> your personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt Out of Sale or Sharing</strong> of your personal information.</li>
    <li><strong>Non-Discrimination</strong> &mdash; we will not treat you differently for exercising your rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>To opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, use the <strong>"Do Not Sell My Personal Information"</strong> toggle in the Game's Settings menu. You may also contact us at <strong>euzauc@gmail.com</strong>.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of users under 16.</p>

<h3>6.3 Exercising Your Rights</h3>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, you may:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use the <strong>Settings</strong> menu in the Game to adjust consent preferences or delete your account.</li>
    <li>Email us at <strong>euzauc@gmail.com</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All gameplay data, progress, preferences, and purchase records are stored locally on your device using standard platform storage (PlayerPrefs). We do not operate servers that store your personal gameplay data.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Storage:</strong> Advertising partners and platform providers (Apple/Google) may store data on their servers according to their own retention policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention Period:</strong> Local data persists until you delete your account in-game or uninstall the Game. Since all data is stored on-device, uninstalling the Game removes all locally stored data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Account Deletion</h2>
<p>You may delete all of your data at any time using the <strong>"Delete Account"</strong> option in the Game's Settings menu. This permanently erases all locally stored data, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Game progress, achievements, and statistics</li>
    <li>Purchase records and virtual currency balances</li>
    <li>Battle pass progress</li>
    <li>Daily challenge progress and login streaks</li>
    <li>All consent and privacy preferences</li>
</ul>
<p>After deletion, the Game will restart with the initial age gate and consent flow. Note that purchase transactions processed by Apple or Google are subject to their respective data retention policies.</p>

<h2>9. Data Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Since gameplay data is stored locally on your device, it is protected by your device's built-in security features (passcode, biometric lock, encryption). Third-party SDK communications use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS/TLS).</p>

<h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>If you use the Game outside the United States, your information may be transferred to and processed in the United States or other countries where our third-party partners operate. These transfers are necessary to serve advertisements and process purchases. Where required, appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) are in place.</p>

<h2>11. Do Not Track</h2>
<p>The Game responds to iOS App Tracking Transparency preferences and in-game consent settings. There is no universal "Do Not Track" standard for mobile applications, but we honor your opt-out choices as described in Section 4.</p>

<h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. If changes are material, we will notify you through the Game (e.g., by re-displaying the consent dialog). Your continued use of the Game after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

<h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
